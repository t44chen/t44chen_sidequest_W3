## Description

This game is an interactive “Island Survival” strategy game. Players must select 5 items from a set of 10 to maximize their chances of survival. Each item possesses a specific survival value. The game's outcome is determined by the player's specific choices, resulting in one of three outcomes: Survival Master, Barely Survived, or Perished on the Island.

## Iteration Notes

Post-Playtest:
- This is a strategy game where results depend on player logic through item selection. I redesigned the gameplay multiple times to achieve a user-friendly interface.  
- Early versions sorted items by value, making gameplay too simple. A shuffle algorithm now randomly adjusts grid positions upon each restart.  
- The “Embark” button obscured the selected item list in the backpack area. I've increased the bottom bar height and lowered the button to ensure all text remains clearly readable.
  
Post-Showcase:
- Currently, items are represented by text boxes. A future update can replace these with specific icons or illustrations for each item to improve visual immersion.
- Can also add some audio feedback, such as a "zip" sound when packing an item and distinct musical cues for the endings.
