## Description

This game is an interactive “Island Survival” strategy game. Players must select 5 items from a set of 10 to maximize their chances of survival. Each item possesses a specific survival value. The game's outcome is determined by the player's specific choices, resulting in one of three outcomes: Survival Master, Barely Survived, or Perished on the Island.

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to move between the Start screen, the Game screen, and the Result screen.
- Practice using arrays (lists) to store information about game items, like their names and values.
- Write code that adds up points based on which items the player selected.
- Create an "Embark" button that only works when the player has followed the rules (picking exactly 5 items).
- Use loops to automatically arrange items in neat rows and columns.
- Learn how to shuffle items so they appear in different places every time you restart the game.
