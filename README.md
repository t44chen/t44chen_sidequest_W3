## Description

This game is an interactive “Island Survival” strategy game. Players must select 5 items from a set of 10 to maximize their chances of survival. Each item possesses a specific survival value. The game's outcome is determined by the player's specific choices, resulting in one of three outcomes: Survival Master, Barely Survived, or Perished on the Island.

## Iteration Notes

Post-Playtest:
- Initially, the game was a simple random "coin flip" (Win/Lose). We changed this to a strategic "Survival" mode where players choose specific items, making the outcome based on player logic rather than pure luck.
- Early versions listed items in order of value, making the game too easy. We added a shuffling algorithm to randomize the grid positions every time the game restarts, preventing players from simply memorizing the "best" spots.
- Users reported that the "Embark" button was covering up the list of selected items in the backpack bar. We increased the height of the bottom bar (from 150px to 200px) and moved the button lower to ensure all text is legible.
  
Post-Showcase:
- Currently, items are represented by text boxes. A future update can replace these with specific icons or illustrations for each item to improve visual immersion.
- Can also add some audio feedback, such as a "zip" sound when packing an item and distinct musical cues for the endings.
